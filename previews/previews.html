  <h3>2D tile lighting experiment</h3>
  <h3>2/17/2024</h3>
  <p> - </p>
  <p>Here's some fun stuff I made during a vacation in December. I wanted to find ways to generate environments faster, as well finding ways to auto generate lighting/environmental effects</p>
  <p>A lot of this originated from the idea of having the final generated room saved as a png, meaning the room-generator code can be as complicated as I feel like without any performance hit ingame.</p>
  <p> - </p>
  <p>A little tile-generator I made. Uses distortion shader and surfaces with extra color on top to generate an image. Notably, when generated it saved itself as an image, meaning there isn't any real performance cost.</p>

  <p>Extra work on the tile thing, this time with the red channel used to pack "depth" into the image. Gives quite a fun 3d feel I think.</p>

  <p>Another small test with the tiles in a more full envoirment. This one was made as a joke, trying to emulate rainworld</p>
